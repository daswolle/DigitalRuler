This app is extremely easy to use! This app was designed to help you measure things by simply sliding your phone.\n\n

Hold down the start button until the ring fills up all the way. Then, when you see the word \'GO!\', you can start sliding your phone.\n\n

When you moved the phone a distance you want to measure, just release the button and give it a second to complete some calculations.\n\n

Be sure to keep the phone completely flat on the surface while measuring, otherwise there can be some problems.\n\n

That\'s it! Happy measuring!
